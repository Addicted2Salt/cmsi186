Welcome to my SkateRampArea program!

To start the calculator run the following:
javac SkateRampArea.java
java SkateRampArea

This will give an error since there are no arguments, but it will display the functions you can use.

This program can estimate the following functions:
polynomial
sin
cos
asin Domain: [-1, 1]
acos Domain: [-1, 1]
atan
sinh
cosh
tanh

polynomial can take any amount of arguments, but the other functions can only take 3 coefficients at most. (lower bound, upper bound, optional %)
